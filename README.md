## 🚀 About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on projects in **quantum computing**, **machine learning**, and **Full Stack**.
- 🌱 I’m always learning something new! Currently diving deeper into **Quantum** and **Data Managment**.
- 💬 Ask me about **ScriptoMath**, **Computer Vision**, **React**, **C++**, and **Python** .
- 👨‍🏫 In addition to programming, I enjoy Working out, Helping with HacKSU (Kent State Univserity coding club) and Video Games.

## Repos to Check out

- **Machine Learning:**
- [Blink](https://github.com/Cars-n/blink) is a software development project where we used Scrum and Agile in a group of 9 people to create a game over the semester. My major contribution was the blinking detection using tensorflow.js.
- [ScriptoMath](https://github.com/CorneliusPavlic/homework-to-text) is my Research Project over the summer, I built a detection for individual expressions as well as training a model on a dataset I created for character recognition. [Click Here](https://scriptomath.guans.cs.kent.edu/)
- [GazeXR](https://github.com/CorneliusPavlic/GazeXR) is another one of my  Research Projects, focused on detecting students and teachers in a 360 video of a classroom and then identifying who a person is looking at at a particular time using Data collected from a VR headset about their Gaze.

**React**
- [My Personal Website](https://github.com/CorneliusPavlic/AWSFaceAuthentication) was a Project I decided to take on when I was learning about AWS in my free time this summer. I built up a resume website with my projects using a multitude of AWS services (Click Here)[corneliuspavlic.com]

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Languages
- **Python**: Primary language for data science, machine learning, and backend projects.
- **C++**: For efficient and high-performance applications, especially in system-level programming and for Design Patterns.
